            As an alternative to FDA-approved branded products, where appropriate, a provider may prescribe a compounded drug, which is prepared by a state-licensed sterile compounding pharmacy partner. Although compounded drugs are permitted to be prescribed under federal law, they are not FDA-approved and do not undergo safety, effectiveness, or manufacturing review. Products like Viagra and Cialis are FDA-approved for treating erectile dysfunction. Your provider may also offer personalized recommendations.
